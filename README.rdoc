== jax-coldet

A fast collision detection library for the {Jax}[http://github.com/sinisterchipmunk/jax] WebGL framework.

=== About

This library uses a combination of BSP trees, bounding boxes and the built-in +Jax.Geometry.Triangle+ to perform collision detection using an arbitrary mesh. Objects don't have to use the same mesh for collision as they do for rendering; they can use a completely separate mesh (for instance, a specially-tailored collision mesh with fewer vertices or a different shape) for collision testing.
